# Questions?

# Chapter 1: Economic Questions and Data

## 1.1 Economic Questions We Examine

**From SW slides p2-p14**

## 1.2 Causal Effects and Idealized Experiments

### Estimation of Causal effects

- Randomized Control Experiement (Randomized control trial, RCT): treatment group, control group
- Causal Effect: the effect on an outcome of a given action or treatment as measured in an ideal randomized controlled experiment. 

### Forecasting and Causality

- Policy implication
- Trending: Machine Learning (ML)
- Stories from ML: causality is not necessary for prediction
- ML vs. Econometrics

## Causality

## 1.3 Data: Sources and Types

### Experiment versus Observational Data

### Randomized Control Trial (RCT)

A randomized control trial (RCT) is a type of scientific (often medical) experiment which aims to reduce bias when testing a new treatment. The people participating in the trial are randomly allocated to either the group receiving the treatment under investigation or to a group receiving standard treatment (or placebo treatment) as the control. 

- Treatment group (school programs, development economics... )
- Control group

## Cross-sectional Data

Data on different entities -- workers, consumers, firms, governmental units, and so forth -- for a single time period are called **cross-sectional data**.

## Time Serious Data

**Time series data** are data for a single entity (person, firm, country) collected at multiple time periods.

## Panel Data (Longitudinal Data)

**Panel data**, also called **longitudinal data**, are data for multiple entities in which each entity is observed at two or more time periods. 

- For example: GDP of all US states from 2000 to 2016.

### Famous Panel Data

- The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) is the longest running longitudinal household survey in the world 

- The study began in 1968 with a nationally representative sample of over 18,000 individuals living in 5,000 families in the United States. Information on these individuals and their descendants has been collected continuously, including data covering employment, income, wealth, expenditures, health, marriage, childbearing, child development, philanthropy, education, and numerous other topics.


# Research Frontier: Two Examples

## How does aging affect athlete performance (world record level)? (1)

### Have a story first

- Important question?
- How? Mechanisms?

### Technical part

- How do we test that? 
- Can we do experiment?
- What kind of data do we need?

## How does aging affect athlete performance (world record level)? (2)

# Review some concepts

## Multiple Choice

Analyzing the behavior of unemployment rates across U.S. states in March of 2006 is an example of using

- A  time series data.
- B  panel data.
- C  cross-sectional data.
- D  experimental data.

## Multiple Choice

Studying inflation in the United States from 1970 to 2006 is an example of using

- A  randomized controlled experiments.
- B  time series data.
- C panel data.
- D cross-sectional data.

## Multiple Choice

Analyzing the effect of minimum wage changes on teenage employment across the 48 contiguous U.S. states from 1980 to 2004 is an example of using

- A  time series data.
- B  panel data.
- C  having a treatment group vs. a control group, since only teenagers receive minimum wages.
- D  cross-sectional data.

## Multiple Choice

Panel data

- A  is also called longitudinal data.
- B  is the same as time series data.
- C  studies a group of people at a point in time.
- D  typically uses control and treatment groups.

## Multiple Choice

An example of a randomized controlled experiment is when

- A  households receive a tax rebate in one year but not the other.
- B  one U.S. state increases minimum wages and an adjacent state does not, and employment differences are observed.
- C  random variables are controlled for by holding constant other factors.
- D  some 5th graders in a specific elementary school are allowed to use computers at school while others are not, and their end-of-year performance is compared holding constant other factors.

## Multiple Choice

In a randomized controlled experiment

- A  there is a control group and a treatment group.
- B  you control for the effect that random numbers are not truly randomly generated
