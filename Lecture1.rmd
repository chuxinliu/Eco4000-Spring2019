## Randomized Control Trial (RCT)

A randomized control trial (RCT) is a type of scientific (often medical) experiment which aims to reduce bias when testing a new treatment. The people participating in the trial are randomly allocated to either the group receiving the treatment under investigation or to a group receiving standard treatment (or placebo treatment) as the control. 

- Treatment group (school programs, development economics... )
- Control group
